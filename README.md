NAME
====

Discogs::API - Provide basic API to Discogs

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Discogs::API;
my $discogs = Discogs.new;

my $release = $discogs.release(249504);
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Discogs::API provides a Raku library with access to the [Discogs](https://discogs.com) data and functions. It tries to follow the API as closely as possible, so the up-to-date [Discogs developer information](https://www.discogs.com/developers) can be used to look up matters that are unclear from thie documentation in this module.

One exception to this rule is that fieldnames in the JSON generated by Discogs that are using snake_case, are converted to use kebab-case in the Raku interface. So a field called `allows_multiple_values` in the JSON blob, will be accessible using a `allow-multiple-values` method in this module.

UTILITY METHODS
===============

new
---

```raku
my $discogs = Discogs.new(
  client   => $client,     # Cro::HTTP::Client compatible, optional
  token    => "xfhgh1624", # Discogs access token, default: none
  key      => "kahgjkhdg", # Discogs access key, default: none
  secret   => "454215642", # Discogs access secret, default: none
  currency => "EUR",       # default: "USD"
  per-page => 10,          # default: 50
;
```

Create an object to access the services that the Discogs API has to offer.

  * client - a Cro::HTTP::Client compatible client

One will be provided if not specified.

  * token - Discogs Access Token

A token needed to access certain parts of the Discogs API. See [https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) for more information. Defaults to whatever is specified with the DISCOGS_TOKEN environment variable.

  * key - Discogs Access Key

A string needed to access certain parts of the Discogs API. See [https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication) for more information.

  * secret - Discogs Access Secret

A string needed to access certain parts of the Discogs API. See [https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication) for more information.

  * currency

A string indicating the default currency to be used when producing prices of releases in the Discogs Marketplace. It should be one of the following strings:

    USD GBP EUR CAD AUD JPY CHF MXN BRL NZD SEK ZAR

  * per-page

An integer indicating the default number of items per page that should be produced by methods that return objects that support pagination.

client
------

```raku
my $default = Discogs::API.client;  # the default client

my $client = $discogs.client;       # the actual client to be used
```

Return the default `Cro::HTTP::Client` object when called as a class method. That object will be used by default when creating a `Discogs::API` object. Intended to be used as a base for alterations, e.g. by overriding the `GET` method during testing.

Returns the actual object that was (implicitely) specified during the creation of the `Discogs::API` object when called as an instance method.

GET
---

```raku
my $content = $discogs.GET("/artists/108713", Discogs::API::Artist);
```

Helper method to fetch data using the Discogs API for the given URI, and interpret it as data of the given class. Returns an instance of the given class, or throws if something went wrong.

test-with
---------

```raku
my $discogs = Discogs::API.new.test-with($path);
```

Provide an alternate [Discogs::API](Discogs::API) object that can be used for testing. Instead of fetching the data from Discogs, it will look at the indicated path and map the URI to a file with the same name. So an URI like `"/artist/108713"` and a path `"foo/bar".IO` will look for a file called `"foo/bar/artist/108713.json"`, slurp that, and create the requested object out of that.
